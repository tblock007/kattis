My Kattis solutions

Please note that these are written in "competitive programming" style, and are not representative of typical coding best practices.

All source files are named using the problem ID.  If the solution is a work in progress and has not yet been accepted, it will be 
prefixed with the verdict.

C++ is my main language, but I've also been using the easier problems to brush up on my Python.
